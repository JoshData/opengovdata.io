Open Government Data Definition: The 8 Principles of Open Government Data
=========================================================================

The 8 Principles of Open Government Data were authored by a working group convened by Carl Malamud on December 8, 2007 in Sebastopol, California. The 8 Principles can be found at [opengovdata.org](http://www.opengovdata.org).

Though these principles were written early in the open government data movement, they continue to be relevant. Parts are, however, admittedly U.S.-centric, especially the principle regarding licensing. See [No Discrimination and License-Free](/2014/no-discrimination-license-free/) for a discussion. The principles also neglected to mention cost and that availability meant digitally over the Internet.
