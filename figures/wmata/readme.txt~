Metrorail Passenger Surveys: Average Weekday Passenger Boardings
http://www.wmata.com/pdfs/planning/Historical%20Rail%20Ridership%20By%20Station.pdf
pdftotext -layout Historical\ Rail\ Ridership\ By\ Station.pdf
open in a text editor and put quotes around multi-word station names
oocalc Historical\ Rail\ Ridership\ By\ Station.txt (it's tricky to get it to load txt as a spreadsheet in File|Open)
	spearated by: space
	text delimiter: double quote (same as above)
	merge delimiters
	delete header, footer, repeated headers in the middle, but not the totals
		row 1: header (year)
		rows 2-87: station names
		row 88: totals
	find/replace to remove asterisks in col headers
	note how oocalc interprets -'s in source as indicating a certain formatting that causes -0's, but
	double check the import worked by comparing computed column sums with the sums contained in the original table
		insert row above 88, add =SUM(B2:B87) and stretch that across the table
		check numbers match
		notice 2008 has "####" in the original
		delete the two sum rows
	add gtfs_stop_id column by looking through the google_transit stops.txt file; here are some diffs:
		historical | google_transit
		Gallery Place-Chinatown | GALLERY PLACE CHINATOWN METRO STATION
		Rhode Island Ave. | RHODE ISLAND METRO STATION
			cf several dozen bus stops on Rhode Island Ave which all look like "NW RHODE ISLAND AV & NW 3RD ST"
		Brookland | BROOKLAND-CUA METRO
		McPherson Square | MCPHERSON SQ METRO STATION
		Nat'l Airport (Regan) | NATIONAL AIRPORT METRO STATION
	correct station names: one had one character truncated off at end
	save as csv
	took about 20 min
